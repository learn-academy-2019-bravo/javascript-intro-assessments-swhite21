# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
a function is a reusable block of code that takes in arguments and does something with them. a function would be used in cases where you want to run multiple variables or data sets through the same process. for example if you wanted to make a program that filtered a certain word or phrase out of an array you would use a function so that your filter could be called to filter multiple arrays rather than re-writing code and having each array hard coded in the filter.

#### 2. What is a method?
a method is a piece of code built into javascript that can take a certain data type and run it through a certain process depending on the method called. Methods vary based on data type, meaning each data type has its own unique methods though there are some exceptions of the same method being usable on multiple data types.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
for example, if you have a variable with the datatype of string you can use the string method "string.length()" to return the number of characters in any given string. Another example of a method is the ".forEach()" method which is used for arrays and will iterate through any given array and run each element through a specified function.
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
an accessor is a method that accesses an array and returns a value or altered value from an array without changing the values in the original array. A mutator is a method that alters the original array instead of creating just pulling a value.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log is used to print information to the console log and a return is used to return data from a function to be used later in a program. console log is more useful for debugging and making sure your logic works in a function for example. a return would be used in a function to return usable data from a function
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
I really like how the information we learn is run through in a brief lecture format then re-iterated through challenges and hands on project time
